# Password Generator

## Description

My motivation for this task was to create a application that employees can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive to different wbe pages sizes. The app run's in the browser, and feature's dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write.

The generate password follows the follwing criteria: 

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
